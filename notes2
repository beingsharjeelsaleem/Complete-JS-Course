Project Idea: Advanced Personal Finance Dashboard

Project Goal: Build a finance dashboard where users can track incomes and expenses, categorize them, filter/sort them, and visualize totals.

Features to Implement:

Add Income & Expenses

Two forms: one for income, one for expense.

Each entry has:

Name/Description

Amount

Category (e.g., Salary, Food, Shopping, Bills)

Date (auto or user input)

Store in localStorage.

Display Entries

Show entries in a table or card layout.

Include a delete button for each entry.

Filter & Sort

Filter by category or type (Income/Expense).

Sort by:

Date (newest → oldest)

Amount (low → high, high → low)

Totals & Balance

Show total income, total expenses, and current balance.

Update totals automatically when entries are added, deleted, or filtered.

Charts (Optional, Advanced)

Use Chart.js or a simple bar/pie chart to visualize:

Expense distribution by category

Income vs Expenses

Persistence

Everything stored in localStorage, so refreshing doesn’t lose data.

Why This Is Complex

Multiple types of data (income & expense)

Multiple features working together: add, delete, filter, sort, total calculation

Optional: Visualization with charts

Forces you to think modularly (functions for add, delete, render, update totals, filter, sort, etc.)

Optional Stretch Goals

Monthly budget tracking: show monthly income, expense, and balance

Editable entries: allow users to edit an expense instead of just deleting

Search functionality: search by name/description
